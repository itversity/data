Self Evaluation

The course is designed in such a way that one can self evaluate through the course and confirm whether the skills are acquired.

Here is the approach we recommend you to take this course.

Go through the consolidated exercises and see if you are able to solve the problems or not.

Make sure to follow the order we have defined as part of the course.

After each and every section or module, make sure to solve the exercises. We have provided enough information to validate the output of your queries.

After the completion of the course try to solve the exercises using consolidated list.

Keep in mind that you will be reviewing the same exercises before the course, during the course as well as at the end of the course.

By the end of the course, if you are able to solve the problems, then you can come to a conclusion that you are able to master the core programming using one of the most popular programming language called as Python.

Developed by AWS Generative AI Worldwide Foundations Lead Emily Webber, this free hands-on course and the supporting GitHub source code. If you are looking for a curated playlist of the top resources, concepts, and guidance to get up to speed on foundation models, and especially those that unlock generative capabilities in your data science and machine learning projects, then look no further.

During this 8-hour deep dive, you will be introduced to the key techniques, services, and trends that will help you understand foundation models from the ground up. This means breaking down theory, mathematics, and abstract concepts combined with hands-on exercises to gain functional intuition for practical application. Throughout the course, we focus on a wide spectrum of progressively complex generative AI techniques, giving you a strong base to understand, design, and apply your own models for the best performance. We‚Äôll start with recapping foundation models, understanding where they come from, how they work, how they relate to generative AI, and what you can to do customize them. You‚Äôll then learn about picking the right foundation model to suit your use case.

Once you‚Äôve developed a strong contextual understanding of foundation models and how to use them, you‚Äôll be introduced to the core subject of this course: pre-training new foundation models. You‚Äôll learn why you‚Äôd want to do this as well as how and where it‚Äôs competitive. You‚Äôll even learn how to use the scaling laws to pick the right model, dataset, and compute sizes. We‚Äôll cover preparing training datasets at scale on AWS, including picking the right instances and storage techniques. We‚Äôll cover fine-tuning your foundation models, evaluating recent techniques, and understanding how to run these with your scripts and models. We‚Äôll dive into reinforcement learning with human feedback, exploring how to use it skillfully and at scale to truly maximize your foundation model performance.

Finally, you‚Äôll learn how to apply theory to production by deploying your new foundation model on Amazon SageMaker, including across multiple GPUs and using top design patterns like retrieval augmented generation and chained dialogue. As an added bonus, we‚Äôll walk you through a Stable Diffusion deep dive, prompt engineering best practices, standing up LangChain, and more.

Developers love MySQL as an OLTP database. When it comes to analytics use cases, though, poor performance with queries often forces them to go through a complex, time-consuming and expensive extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to move data to a second analytics database. Oracle MySQL Database Service with HeatWave is the first and currently only MySQL cloud service to cost effectively solve this MySQL analytics problem.

HeatWave is a tightly integrated, high performance, in-memory query accelerator for the Oracle MySQL Database Service. It allows customers to run very fast analytics queries directly against their MySQL databases entirely avoiding the step of data ETL into a second analytics database. HeatWave scales out to thousands of cores, is 1,100 times faster at query performance than Amazon Aurora, and is 2.7 times faster than Amazon Redshift‚Äîat one-third the cost.

Please join our Oracle Live event where you'll learn about a series of powerful innovations to the Oracle MySQL Database Service that will increase automation, further improve performance, and increase the set of workloads that are accelerated by HeatWave.

Edward Screven, Oracle's chief corporate architect, shares our latest innovations, along with the latest benchmarks, that show the speed and cost savings gained with HeatWave.",2021-08-09,5,2025-01-10T12:29:47.580670,2025-01-10T12:29:47.580670
